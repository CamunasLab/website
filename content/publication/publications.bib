              et al.
              developed two noninvasive blood tests that provide a window into the progression of individual pregnancies.

The second blood test, also examined in a small pilot study, discriminated women at risk of preterm delivery from those who delivered at full term.

          , 
            Noninvasive blood tests that provide information about fetal development and gestational age could potentially improve prenatal care. Ultrasound, the current gold standard, is not always affordable in low-resource settings and does not predict spontaneous preterm birth, a leading cause of infant death. In a pilot study of 31 healthy pregnant women, we found that measurement of nine cell-free RNA (cfRNA) transcripts in maternal blood predicted gestational age with comparable accuracy to ultrasound but at substantially lower cost. In a related study of 38 women (25 full-term and 13 preterm deliveries), all at elevated risk of delivering preterm, we identified seven cfRNA transcripts that accurately classified women who delivered preterm up to 2 months in advance of labor. These tests hold promise for prenatal care in both the developed and developing worlds, although they require validation in larger, blinded clinical trials.},

              1
              . Yet the ability to assess underlying pathophysiology before clinical presentation to enable identification of pregnancies at risk remains elusive. Here we demonstrate the ability of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) to reveal patterns of normal pregnancy progression and determine the risk of developing pre-eclampsia months before clinical presentation. Our results centre on comprehensive transcriptome data from eight independent prospectively collected cohorts comprising 1,840 racially diverse pregnancies and retrospective analysis of 2,539 banked plasma samples. The pre-eclampsia data include 524 samples (72 cases and 452 non-cases) from two diverse independent cohorts collected 14.5 weeks (s.d., 4.5 weeks) before delivery. We show that cfRNA signatures from a single blood draw can track pregnancy progression at the placental, maternal and fetal levels and can robustly predict pre-eclampsia, with a sensitivity of 75\% and a positive predictive value of 32.3\% (s.d., 3\%), which is superior to the state-of-the-art method

              . cfRNA signatures of normal pregnancy progression and pre-eclampsia are independent of clinical factors, such as maternal age, body mass index and race, which cumulatively account for less than 1\% of model variance. Further, the cfRNA signature for pre-eclampsia contains gene features linked to biological processes implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia.},

            I review recent technological advancements in coupling single-cell transcriptomics with cellular phenotypes including morphology, calcium signaling, and electrophysiology. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has revolutionized cell type classifications by capturing the transcriptional diversity of cells. A new wave of methods to integrate scRNAseq and biophysical measurements is facilitating the linkage of transcriptomic data to cellular function, which provides physiological insight into cellular states. I briefly discuss critical factors of these phenotypical characterizations such as timescales, information content, and analytical tools. Dedicated sections focus on the integration with cell morphology, calcium imaging, and electrophysiology (patch-seq), emphasizing their complementary roles. I discuss their application in elucidating cellular states, refining cell type classifications, and uncovering functional differences in cell subtypes. To illustrate the practical applications and benefits of these methods, I highlight their use in tissues with excitable cell-types such as the brain, pancreatic islets, and the retina. The potential of combining functional phenotyping with spatial transcriptomics for a detailed mapping of cell phenotypes in situ is explored. Finally, I discuss open questions and future perspectives, emphasizing the need for a shift towards broader accessibility through increased throughput.},

            A fluctuation theorem for ligand binding allows binding energies to be extracted from single-molecule pulling experiments.
          , 
            Thermodynamic bulk measurements of binding reactions rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet, important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow these assumptions and may require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity, and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model-independent fashion. A similar approach could be used for proteins. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions, bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium.},

              BACKGROUND
              Prenatal diagnosis in pregnancies at risk of single-gene disorders is currently performed using invasive methods such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. This is in contrast with screening for common aneuploidies, for which noninvasive methods with a single maternal blood sample have become standard clinical practice.
            
            
              METHODS
              We developed a protocol for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of inherited single-gene disorders using droplet digital PCR from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma. First, the amount of cfDNA and fetal fraction is determined using a panel of TaqMan assays targeting high-variability single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Second, the ratio of healthy and diseased alleles in maternal plasma is quantified using TaqMan assays targeting the mutations carried by the parents. Two validation approaches of the mutation assay are presented.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We collected blood samples from 9 pregnancies at risk for different single-gene disorders, including common conditions and rare metabolic disorders. We measured cases at risk of hemophilia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, β-thalassemia, mevalonate kinase deficiency, acetylcholine receptor deficiency, and DFNB1 nonsyndromic hearing loss. We correctly differentiated affected and unaffected pregnancies (2 affected, 7 unaffected), confirmed by neonatal testing. We successfully measured an affected pregnancy as early as week 11 and with a fetal fraction as low as 3.7\% (0.3).
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Our method detects single-nucleotide mutations of autosomal recessive diseases as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. This is of importance for metabolic disorders in which early diagnosis can affect management of the disease and reduce complications and anxiety related to invasive testing.},

            Through massive shotgun sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA from the blood of more than 1,000 independent samples, we identified hundreds of new bacteria and viruses which represent previously unidentified members of the human microbiome. Previous studies targeted specific niches such as feces, skin, or the oral cavity, whereas our approach of using blood effectively enables sampling of the entire body and reveals the colonization of niches which have been previously inaccessible. We were thus able to discover that the human body contains a vast and unexpected diversity of microbes, many of which have highly divergent relationships to the known tree of life.

            Blood circulates throughout the human body and contains molecules drawn from virtually every tissue, including the microbes and viruses which colonize the body. Through massive shotgun sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA from the blood, we identified hundreds of new bacteria and viruses which represent previously unidentified members of the human microbiome. Analyzing cumulative sequence data from 1,351 blood samples collected from 188 patients enabled us to assemble 7,190 contiguous regions (contigs) larger than 1 kbp, of which 3,761 are novel with little or no sequence homology in any existing databases. The vast majority of these novel contigs possess coding sequences, and we have validated their existence both by finding their presence in independent experiments and by performing direct PCR amplification. When their nearest neighbors are located in the tree of life, many of the organisms represent entirely novel taxa, showing that microbial diversity within the human body is substantially broader than previously appreciated.},

            Most DNA processes are governed by molecular interactions that take place in a sequence-specific manner. Determining the sequence selectivity of DNA ligands is still a challenge, particularly for small drugs where labeling or sequencing methods do not perform well. Here, we present a fast and accurate method based on parallelized single molecule magnetic tweezers to detect the sequence selectivity and characterize the thermodynamics and kinetics of binding in a single assay. Mechanical manipulation of DNA hairpins with an engineered sequence is used to detect ligand binding as blocking events during DNA unzipping, allowing determination of ligand selectivity both for small drugs and large proteins with nearly base-pair resolution in an unbiased fashion. The assay allows investigation of subtle details such as the effect of flanking sequences or binding cooperativity. Unzipping assays on hairpin substrates with an optimized flat free energy landscape containing all binding motifs allows determination of the ligand mechanical footprint, recognition site, and binding orientation.},

We discuss the importance of accurately determining the elastic response in pulling experiments, and we review the simplest models used to rationalize the experimental data as well as the experimental approaches used to pull single-stranded DNA. Applications used to investigate DNA conformational transitions and secondary structure formation are also highlighted. Finally, we provide an overview of the effects of salt and temperature and briefly discuss the effects of contour length and sequence dependence.},

              BACKGROUND
              Plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) encompasses a broad spectrum of RNA species that can be derived from both human cells and microbes. Because cfRNA is fragmented and of low concentration, it has been challenging to profile its transcriptome using standard RNA-seq methods.
            
            
              METHODS
              We assessed several recently developed RNA-seq methods on cfRNA samples. We then analyzed the dynamic changes of both the human transcriptome and the microbiome of plasma during pregnancy from 60 women.
            
            
              RESULTS
              cfRNA reflects a well-orchestrated immune modulation during pregnancy: an up-regulation of antiinflammatory genes and an increased abundance of antimicrobial genes. We observed that the plasma microbiome remained relatively stable during pregnancy. The bacteria Ureaplasma shows an increased prevalence and increased abundance at postpartum, which is likely to be associated with postpartum infection. We demonstrated that cfRNA-seq can be used to monitor viral infections. We detected a number of human pathogens in our patients, including an undiagnosed patient with a high load of human parvovirus B19 virus (B19V), which is known to be a potential cause of complications in pregnancy.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Plasma cfRNA-seq demonstrates the potential to simultaneously monitor immune response and microbial infections during pregnancy.},
